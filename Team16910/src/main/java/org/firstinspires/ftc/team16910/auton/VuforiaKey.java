     * IMPORTANT: You need to obtain your own license key to use Vuforia. The string below with which
     * 'parameters.vuforiaLicenseKey' is initialized is for illustration only, and will not function.
     * A Vuforia 'Development' license key, can be obtained free of charge from the Vuforia developer
     * web site at https://developer.vuforia.com/license-manager.
     *
     * Vuforia license keys are always 380 characters long, and look as if they contain mostly
     * random data. As an example, here is a example of a fragment of a valid key:
     *      ... yIgIzTqZ4mWjk9wd3cZO9T1axEqzuhxoGlfOOI2dRzKS4T0hQ8kT ...
     * Once you've obtained a license key, copy the string from the Vuforia web site
     * and paste it in to your code on the next line, between the double quotes.
